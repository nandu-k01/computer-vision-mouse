# computer-vision-mouse
 This code initializes the Mediapipe and Autopy libraries, sets up the video capture using OpenCV, and then processes each frame from the camera. It uses Mediapipe's hand tracking functionality to detect the landmarks of the hand. It then maps the hand landmarks to the screen coordinates and moves the mouse cursor accordingly using Autopy.
